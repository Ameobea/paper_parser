SCENE: Before the Palace of Creon, King of Thebes. A central double door, and two 
lateral  doors.  A  platform  extends  the  length  of  the  façade,  and  from  this  platform 
three steps lead down into the “orchestra”, or chorus-ground. TIME: Dawn of the 
day after the repulse of the Argive army from the assault on Thebes. 
 

[ANTIGONE and ISMENE enter from the central door of the Palace.] 

PROLOGUE 

 

 

ANTIGONE: 

Ismene, dear sister, 
You would think that we had already suffered enough 
For the curse on Oedipus:1  
I cannot imagine any grief 
That you and I have not gone through. And now –– 
Have they told you of the new decree of our King Creon? 

 

 
ISMENE: 

I have heard nothing: I know 
That two sisters lost two brothers, a double death 
In a single hour; and I know that the Argive army 
Fled in the night; but beyond this, nothing. 
 
 

 

ANTIGONE: 

I thought so. And that is why I wanted you 
To come out here with me. There is something we must do.

1 Oedipus, once King of Thebes, was the father of Antigone and Ismene, and of their brothers Polyneices and Eteocles. Oedipus 
unwittingly  killed  his  father,  Laios,  and  married  his  own  mother,  Iocaste.  When  he  learned  what  he  had  done,  he  blinded 
himself and left Thebes. Eteocles and Polyneices quarreled, Polyneices was driven out but returned to assault Thebes. In the 
battle each brother killed the other; Creon became king and ordered that Polyneices be left to rot unburied on the battlefield as a 
traitor. [Editors’ note] 

Why do you speak so strangely? 

ISMENE: 

 
ANTIGONE: 

 

 

 

 

Listen, Ismenê: 
Creon buried our brother Eteoclês 
With military honors, gave him a soldier’s funeral, 
And it was right that he should; but Polyneicês, 
They fought as bravely and died as miserably,-- 
They say that Creon has sworn 
No one shall burry him, no one mourn for him,   
But this body must lie in the fields, a sweet treasure 
For carrion birds to find as they search for food. 
That is what they say, and our good Creon is coming here 
To announce it publicly; and the penalty –– 
Stoning to death I the public squarel 
 
And now you can prove what you are: 
A true sister, or a traitor to your family. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There it is,

Antigone, you are mad! What could I possibly do? 

You must decide whether you will help me or not. 

I do not understand you. Help you in what? 
 

 

 

Ismene, I am going to bury him. Will you come? 

Bury him! You have just said the new law forbids it. 

He is my brother. And he is your brother, too. 
 

But think of the danger! Think what Creon will do!

For what his own search brought to light, his eyes 
Ripped out by his own hand; and Iocaste died, 
His mother and wife at once: she twisted the cords 
That strangled her life; and our two brothers died, 
Each killed by the other’s sword. And we are left: 
But oh, Antigone, 
Think how much more terrible than these 
Our own death would be if we should go against Creon  
And do what he has forbidden! We are only women, 
We cannot fight with men, Antigone! 
The law is strong, we must give in to the law 
In this thing, and in worse. I beg the Dead 
To forgive me, but I am helpless: I must yield 
To those in authority. And I think it is dangerous business 
To be always meddling. 

 

 

 
ANTIGONE: 

If that is what you think, 
I should not want you, even if you asked to come. 
You have made your choice, you can be what you want to be. 
But I will bury him; and if I must die, 
I say that this crime is holy: I shall lie down 
With him in death, and I shall be as dear 
To him as he to me. 

 

 

 

It is the dead 

Not the living, who make the longest demands: 
We die for ever… 

 
Since apparently the laws of the god mean nothing to you. 

You may do as you like 

 
ISMENE: 

 
ANTIGONE: 

 
ISMENE: 

They mean a great deal to me, but I have no strength 
To break laws that were made for the public good. 

That must be your excuse, I suppose. But as for me, 
I will bury the brother I love. 

Antigone, 

I am so afraid for you! 

 
ANTIGONE: 

You have yourself to consider, after all. 

You need not be: 

 
 

But no one must hear of this, you must tell no one! 
I will keep it a secret, I promise! 

Oh tell it! Tell everyone 
Think how they’ll hate you when it all comes out 
If they learn that you knew about it all the time! 

 

 

70 

So fiery! You should be cold with fear. 

Perhaps. But I am doing only what I must. 

But can you do it? I say that you cannot. 

Very well: when my strength gives out, I shall do no more. 
 

Impossible things should not be tried at all. 

Go away, Ismene: 
I shall be hating you soon, and the dead will too, 
For your words are hateful. Leave me my foolish plan: 
I am not afraid of the danger; if it means death,  
 
It will not be the worst of deaths ––death without honor.

Go then, if you feel that you must.

PARODOS 

 

Now the long blade of the sun, lying 
Level east to west, touches with glory 
Thebes of the Seven Gates. Open, unlidded 
Eye of golden day! O marching light 
Across the eddy and rush of Dirce’s stream, 2 
Striking the white shields of the enemy   
 
Thrown headlong backward from the blaze of morning!

CHORAGOS: 3 

Polyneices their commander 
Roused them with windy phrases, 
He the wild eagle screaming 
Insults above our land, 
His wings their shields of snow, 
His crest their marshaled helms. 

 

 

 
CHORUS: 

[Antistrophe 1] 

 

 

 

 

 
Against our seven gates in a yawning ring 
The famished spears came onward in the night; 
But before his jaws were sated with our blood,   
Or pine fire took the garland of our towers, 
He was thrown back; and as he turned, great Thebes–– 
No tender victim for his noisy power–– 
Rose like a dragon behind him, shouting war. 

 
CHORAGOS: 

 

 

For God hates utterly 
The bray of bragging tongues; 
And when he beheld their smiling, 
Their swagger of golden helms, 
The frown of his thunder blasted 
 
Their first man from our walls 

 

 

 

 

 
CHORUS: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We heard his shout of triumph high in the air 
Turn to a scream; far out in a flaming are 
He fell with his windy torch, and the earth struck him. 
And others storming in fury no less than his 
Found shock of death in the dusty joy of battle   

 
CHORAGOS: 

Seven captains at seven gates 
Yielded their clanging arms to the god 
That bends the battle-line and breaks it. 
These two only, brothers in blood, 
Face to face in matchless rage, 
 
Mirroring each the other’s death, 
Clashed in long combat. 

 

 

 
CHORUS: 

 

 

 

 

 

[Antistrophe 2] 

But now in the beautiful morning of victory 
Let Thebes of the many chariots sing for joy! 
With hearts for dancing we’ll take leave of war:  
Our temples shall be sweet with hymns of praise,

SCENE I 

 
CHORAGUS: 

But now at last our new King is coming: 
Creon of Thebes, Menoikeus’ son. 
In this auspicious dawn of his reign 
What are the new complexities 
That shifting Fate has woven for him? 
What is his counsel? Why has he summoned 
The old men to hear him? 
[Enter CREON from the Palace, C. He addresses the CHORUS 
from the top step.] 

 

 

 

 

 
CREON: 

Gentlemen:  I  have  the  honor  to  inform  you  that  our  Ship  of 
State,  which  recent  storms  have  threatened  to  destroy,  has  come 
safely to harbor at last, guided by the merciful wisdom of Heaven. I 
have  summoned  you  here  this  morning  because  I  know  that  I  can 
depend  upon  you:  your  devotion  to  King  Laios  was  absolute;  you 
never  hesitated  in  your  duty  to  our  late  ruler  Oedipus;  and  when 
Oedipus  died,  your 
to  his  children. 
Unfortunately, as you know, his two sons, the princes Eteocles and 
Polyneices,  have  killed  each  other  in  battle,  and  I,  as  the  next  in 
blood, have succeeded to the full power of the throne. 

loyalty  was 

transferred 

I  am  aware,  of  course,  that  no  Ruler  can  expect  complete 
loyalty  from  his  subjects  until  he  has  been  tested  in  office. 
Nevertheless, I say to you at the very outset that I have nothing but 
contempt for the kind of Governor who is afraid, for whatever reason, 
to follow the course that he knows is best for the State; and as for the 
man who sets private friendship above the public welfare, ––I have 
no use for him, either. I call God to witness that if I saw my country 
headed for ruin, I should not be afraid to speak out plainly; and I need 
hardly  remind  you  that  I  would  never  have  any  dealings  with  an 
enemy  of the  people.  No one  values friendship  more  highly than I; 
but we must remember that friends made at the risk of wrecking our 
Ship are not real friends at all. 

These  are  my  principles,  at  any  rate,  and  that  is  why  I  have 
made  the  following  decision  concerning  the  sons  of  Oedipus: 
Eteocles, who died as a man should die, fighting for his country, is to 
be buried with full military honors, with all the ceremony that is usual 
when the greatest heroes die; but his brother Polyneices, who broke 
his exile to come back with fire and sword against his native city and 
the shrines of his fathers’ gods, whose one idea was to spill the blood 
of his blood and sell his own people into slavery–– Polyneices, I say, 
is to have no burial: no man is to touch him or say the least prayer for

him;  he  shall  lie  on  the  plain,  unburied;  and  the  birds  and  the 
scavenging dogs can do with him whatever they like. 

This is my command, and you can see the wisdom behind it. As 
long as I am  King, no traitor is going to be honored with the  loyal 
man. But whoever shows by word and deed that he is on the side of 
the  State,––he  shall  have  my  respect  while  he  is  living  and  my 
reverence when he is dead. 

If that is your will, Creon son of Menoikeus, 
You have the right to enforce it: we are yours. 

 

 

 

180 

That is my will. Take care that you do your part. 

We are old men: let the younger ones carry it out. 

I do not mean that: the sentries have been appointed. 

Then what is t that you would have us do? 

You will give no support to whoever breaks this law.

[Enter SENTRY from L.] 

I’ll not say that I’m out of breath from running, King, because every 
time I stopped to think about what I have to tell you, I felt like going 
back.  And  all  the  time  a  voice  kept  saying,  “You  fool,  don’t  you 
know you’re walking straight into trouble?”; and then another voice: 
“Yes, but if you let somebody else get the news to Creon first, it will 
be even worse than that for you!” But good sense won out, at least I 
hope  it  was  good  sense,  and  here  I  am  with  a  story  that  makes  no 
sense at all; but I’ll tell it anyhow, because, as they say, what’s going 
to happen’s going to happen, and–– 

 
 
 
175 
 

 
190 
 
 
 
195 
 

Come to the point. What have you to say? 

I did not it. I did not see who did it. You must not punish me for what someone 
else has done. 

A comprehensive defense! More effective, perhaps,  
If I knew its purpose. Come: what is it? 

A dreadful thing… I don’t know how to put it–– 

CREON: 

 
SENTRY: 

 
CREON: 

 
SENTRY: 

 
CREON: 

 
SENTRY: 

Out with it! 

Well, then; 

The dead man––– 

Polyneices–– 

[Pause. The SENTRY is overcome, fumbles for words. CREON 
waits impassively.] 

out there–– 

someone, –– 

 

new dust on the slimy flesh! 
[Pause. No sign from CREON.] 
Someone has given it burial that way, and 
Gone … 
[Long pause. CREON finally speaks with deadly control.] 

 
CREON: 

 
SENTRY: 

And the man who dared do this? 

Do not know! You must believe me! 

I swear I  

 

 

Listen: 

The ground was dry, not a sign of digging, no, 
Not a wheel track in the dust, no trace of anyone. 
It was when they relieved us this morning: and one of them, 
The corporal, pointed to it. 
 
The strangest–– 
 
The body, just mounded over with light dust: you see? 
Not buried really, but as if they’d covered it 

There it was, 

Look: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

205 

210 

215 

 

 

Just enough for the ghost’s peace. And no sign 
Of dogs or any wild animal that had been there.  
 
And then what a scene there was! Every man of us 
Accusing the other: we all proved the other man did it, 
We all had proof that we could not have done it. 
We were ready to take hot iron in our hands, 
Walk through fire, swear by all the gods, 
It was not I!  
 
I do not know who it was, but it was not I! 
[CREON’s rage has been mounting steadily, but the SENTRY 
is too intent upon his story to notice it.] 
And then, when this came to nothing, someone said 
A thing that silenced us and made us stare 
Down at the ground: you had to be told the news, 
And one of us had to do it! We threw the dice,   
And the bad luck fell to me. So here I am, 
No happier to be here than you are to have me: 
Nobody likes the man who brings bad news. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
CHORAGOS: 

220

   235 

[Furiously.] 

 

240 

I have been wondering, King: can it be that the gods have done this? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
CREON: 
Stop! 
Must you doddering wrecks 
Go out of your heads entirely? “The gods!” 
Intolerable! 
The gods favor this corpse? Why? How had he served them? 
Tried to loot their temples, burn their images, 
Yes, and the whole State, and its laws with it! 
Is it your senile opinion that the gods love to honor bad men? 
A pious thought! –– 

No, from the every beginning 
 

 

 

There have been those who have whispered together, 
Stiff-necked anarchists, putting their heads together, 
Scheming against me in alleys. These are the men, 
And they have bribed my own guard to do this thing. 
 
[Sententiously.] 
Money! 
There’s nothing in the world so demoralizing as money. 
Find that man, bring him here to me, or your death 
Will be the least of your problems: I’ll string you up 
Alive, and there will be certain ways to make you 
Discover your employer before you die; 
And the process may teach you e lesson you seem to have missed 
The dearest profit is sometimes all too dear: 

 

 

 

 

245 

250 

260 

That depends on the source. Do you understand me? 
A fortune won is often misfortune. 

King, may I speak? 

Your very voice distresses me. 

Are you sure that it is my voice, and not your conscience? 

By God, he wants to analyze me now! 

It is not what I say, but what has been done, that hurts you. 

You talk too much. 

Maybe; but I’ve done nothing. 

Sold your soul for some silver: that’s all you’ve done. 

How dreadful it is when the right judge judges wrong!

[Enter CREON into the Palace.] 

“Bring me the man” ––! 
I’d like nothing better than bringing him the man! 
 
But bring him or not, you have seen the last of me here. 
At any rate, I am safe!

Earth, holy and inexhaustible, is graven 
With shining furrows where his plows have gone 
Year after year, the timeless labor of stallions. 
 
 
The lightboned birds and beasts that cling to cover, 
The lithe fish lighting their reaches of dim water, 
All are taken, tamed in the net of his mind; 
The lion on the hill, the wild horse windy-maned, 
Resign to him; and his blunt yoke has broken 
The sultry shoulders of the mountain bull. 
 
 
 
Words also, ant thought as rapid as air,   
He fashions to his good use; statecraft is his, 
And his the skill that deflect the arrows of snow, 
The spears of winter rain: from every wind 
He has made himself secure––from all but one: 
In the late wind of death he cannot stand. 
 
 
 
O clear intelligence, force beyond all measure!   
O fate of man, working both good and evil! 
When the laws are kept, how proudly his city stands! 
When the laws are broken, what of his city then? 
Never may the anarchic man find rest at my hearth, 
Never be it said that my thoughts are his thoughts.

What does this mean? Surely this captive woman 
Is the Princess, Antigone. Why should she be taken? 

Here is the one who did it! We caught her 
In the very act of burying him. ––Where is Creon? 

 
CHORAGOS: 

 
SENTRY: 

 
CHORAGOS: 

 
CREON: 

Just coming from the house. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

[Enter CREON, C.] 

 

 
Why have you come back so soon? 

 

 

 

What has happened?   

 

305 

SENTRY: 

O King, 
A man should never be too sure of anything: 
I would have sworn 
That you’d not see me here again: your anger 
Frightened me so, and the things you threatened me with; 
But how could I tell then 
That I’d be able to solve the case so soon? 
 
No dice-throwing this time: I was only too glad to come! 
 
Here is this woman. She is the guilty one: 
We found her trying to bury him. 
 
Take her, then; question her; judge her as you will. 
I am through with the whole thing now, and glad of it. 

 

 

But this is Antigone! Why have you brought her here? 

She was burying him, I tell you! 

 

 

 

 

 
Is this the truth? 

[Severely.] 

I saw her with my own eyes. Can I say more? 

 

 

 
CREON:

CREON: 

 
SENTRY: 

The details: come, tell me quickly! 

It was like this: 

After those terrible threats of yours King. 
We went back and brushed the dust away from the body. 
The flesh was soft by now, and stinking,  
 
 
So we sat on a hill to windward and kept guard. 
No napping happened until the white round sun 
Whirled in the center of the round sky over us: 
Then, suddenly, 
A storm of dust roared up from the earth, and the sky 
Went out, the plain vanished with all its trees 
In the stinging dark. We closed our eyes and endured it. 
The whirlwind lasted a long time, but it passed; 
And then we looked, and there was Antigone! 
I have seen 
A mother bird come back to a stripped nest, heard

ANTIGONE: 

 
CREON: 

I do. I deny nothing. 

 
 

 

 

340 

And then she brought more dust 

And this was a comfort to me, 

345 

 

 

 

 

Her crying bitterly a broken note or two 
For the young ones stolen. Just so, when this girl 
Found the bare corpse, and all her love’s work wasted, 
She wept, and cried on heaven to damn the hands 
That had done this thing 
 
And sprinkled wine three times for her brother’s ghost. 
We ran and took her at once. She was not afraid, 
Not even when we charged her with what she had done. 
She denied nothing. 
 
And some uneasiness: for it is a good thing 
To escape from death, but it is no great pleasure 
To bring death to a friend. 
 
 
There is nothing so comfortable as your own safe skin! 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Yet I always say 

 

 

 
CREON: 

 

And you, Antigone, 
You with your head hanging––do you confess this thing? 

 
 

 
 

{Slowly, dangerously.] 
 

 

 

350 

 

 

 

 

[To SENTRY:] 

You may go. 

 

 

 
Tell me, tell me briefly: 
Had you heard my proclamation touching this matter? 

 

 

 

{Exit SENTRY. To ANTIGONE:] 

 
ANTIGONE: 

 
CREON: 

 
ANTIGONE: 

It was public. Could I help hearing it? 

 

 

And yet you dared defy the law. 

I dared. 

It was not God’s proclamation. That final Justice 
That rules the world below makes no such laws. 
 
Your edict, King, was strong, 
But all your strength is weakness itself against   
The immortal unrecorded laws of God. 
They are not merely now: they were, and shall be, 
Operative for ever, beyond man utterly. 
 

 

 

 

 

355 

360 

 

 

I knew I must die, even without your decree: 
I am only mortal. And if I must die 
Now, before it is my time to die, 
Surely this is no hardship: can anyone 
Living, as I live, with evil all about me, 
Think Death less than a friend? This death of mine 
Is of no importance; but if I had left my brother  
Lying in death unburied, I should have suffered. 
Now I do not. 
 
You smile at me. Ah Creon, 
Think me a fool, if you like; but it may well be 
That a fool convicts me of folly. 

 

 

 
CHORAGOS: 

Like father, like daughter: both headstrong, deaf to reason! 
She has never learned to yield. 

She has much to learn. 

 

 

 

Pride? In a slave? 

The inflexible heart breaks first, the toughest iron 
Cracks first, and the wildest horses bend their necks 
At the pull of the smallest curb. 
 
This girl is guilty of a double insolence,  
Breaking the given laws and boasting of it. 
Who is the man here, 
She or I, if this crime goes unpunished? 
Sister’s child, or more than sister’s child, 
Or closer yet in blood––she and her sister 
Win bitter death for this! 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Go, some of you, 

[To servants:] 

Arrest Ismene. I accuse her equally. 
Bring her: you will find her sniffling in the house there. 
 
Her mind’s a traitor: crimes kept in the dark 
Cry for light, and the guardian brain shudders: 
But now much worse than this 
Is brazen boasting of barefaced anarchy! 

 

 

Creon, what more do you want than my death?

Nothing. 

Then I beg you: kill me. 

 

This talking is a great weariness: your words 
Are distasteful to me, and I am sure that mine 
Seem so to you. And yet they should not seem so: 
I should have praise and honor for what I have done. 
All these men here would praise me 
Were their lips not frozen shut with fear of you.  
 
 
Ah the good fortune of kings, 
Licensed to say and do whatever they please!

My brother too. 

And you insult his memory? 

ANTIGONE:   

 

 

 

 

The dead man would not say that I insult it. 

 

[Softly.] 

He would: for you honor a traitor as much as him. 
 

 

 

410 

His own brother, traitor or not, and equal in blood. 

He made war on his country. Eteocles defended it. 

Nevertheless, there are honors due all the dead. 

But not the same for the wicked as for the just. 

Ah Creon, Creon,  
 
Which of us can say what the gods hold wicked?

An enemy is an enemy, even dead. 

It is may nature to join in love, not hate.

Go join them, then; if you must have your love, 
Find it in hell!

But see, Ismene comes: 
 
 
Those tears are sisterly, the cloud 
That shadows her eyes rains down gentle sorrow. 

 

 

 

[Enter ISMENE, guarded.] 

You too, Ismene, 
Snake in my ordered house, sucking my blood   
Stealthily––and all the time I never knew 
That these two sisters were aiming at my throne! 
 
 
Do you confess your share in this crime, or deny it? 
Answer me.

No, Ismene. You have no right to say so. 
You would not help me, and I will not have you help me. 

 

 

 

 

[Coldly.] 

But now I know what you meant; and I am here 
To join you, to take my share of punishment. 

The dead man and the gods who rule the dead 
 
Know whose act this was. Words are not friends. 

 

 

435 

Do you refuse me, Antigone? I want to die with you: 
I too have a duty that I must discharge to the dead. 

You shall not lessen my death by sharing it. 

What do I care for life when you are dead? 

 

 

 

440 

Ask Creon. You’re always hanging on his opinions. 

You are laughing at me. Why, Antigone?

But we are equally guilty! 

You are alive, but I belong to Death. 

No more, Ismene. 

 

 

 

 

 

Gentlemen, I beg you to observe these girls: 
One has just now lost her mind; the other, 
It seem, has never had a mind at all. 
 
 

{To the CHORUS:] 

 

 

 

450 

Grief teaches the steadiest minds to waver, King. 

Yours certainly did, when you assumed guild with the guilty! 

But how could I go on living without her? 

 

 
She is already dead. 

 

 

 

 

 

You are. 

But your own son’s bride! 

There are places enough for him to push his plow. 
I want no wicked women for my sons!

ODE II 

 

 

CHORUS: 

 

 

 

 

[Strophe 1] 

Fortunate is the man who has never tasted God’s vengeance! 
 
Where once the anger of heaven has struck, that house is shaken 
For ever: damnation rises behind each child 
Like a wave cresting out of the black northeast, 
When the long darkness under sea roars up 
And bursts drumming death upon the windwhipped sand. 
 
 

 

465 

470 

[Antistrophe 1] 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
I have seen this gathering sorrow from time long past 
Loom upon Oedipus’ children: generation from generation 
Takes the compulsive rage of the enemy god. 
So lately this last flower of Oedipus’ line 
Drank the sunlight! but now a passionate word   
And a handful of dust have closed up all its beauty 
 
  What mortal arrogance 
 
  Transcends the wrath of Zeus? 
Sleep cannot lull him, nor the effortless long months 
Of the timeless gods: but he is young for ever,   
And his house is the shining day of high Olympos. 
  All that is and shall be, 
And all the past, is his. 

 

 

 

 

 

475 

[Strophe 2] 

 

480 

 

No pride on earth is free of the curse of heaven. 
 
The straying dreams of men 
 
  May bring them ghosts of joy: 
But as they drowse, the waking embers burn them; 
Or they walk with fixed eyes, as blind men walk. 
But the ancient wisdom speaks for our own time: 
  Fate works most for woe  
 
  With Folly’s fairest show. 
Man’s little pleasure is the spring of sorrow.

HAIMON: 

 
CREON: 

But here is Haimon, King, the last of all your sons. 
Is it grief for Antigone, that brings him here, 
And bitterness at being robbed of his bride? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
[Enter HAIMON.] 

 

495 

 

 

We shall soon see, and no need of diviners. 
 
––Son, 
You have heard my final judgment on that girl: 
Have you come here hating me, or have you come 
With deference and with love, whatever I do? 

 

 

 

I am your son, father. You are my guide. 
You make things clear for me, and I obey you. 
No marriage means more to me than your continuing wisdom. 

 

 

 

500 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So you are right 

Good. That is the way to behave: subordinate 
Everything else, my son, to your father’s will 
This is what a man prays for, that he may get 
Sons attentive and dutiful in his house, 
Each one hating his father’s enemies, 
Honoring his father’s friends. But if his sons 
Fail him, if they turn out unprofitably, 
What has he fathered but trouble for himself 
And amusement for the malicious? 
 
Not to lose your head over this woman. 
Your pleasure with her would soon, grow cold, Haimon, 
And then you’d have a hellcat in bed and elsewhere. 
Let her find her husband in Hell!  
Of all the people in this city, only she 
Has had contempt for my law and broken it. 
 
Do you want me to show myself weak before the people? 
Or to break my sworn word? No, and I will not. 
The woman dies.  
 
I suppose she’ll plead “family ties.” Well, let her. 
If I permit my own family to rebel, 
How shall I earn the world’s obedience? 
Show me the man who keeps his house in hand, 
He’s fit for public authority. 
 
With law-breakers, critics of the government: 
Whoever is chosen to govern should be obeyed–– 
Must be obeyed, in all things, great and small, 
Just and unjust! O Haimon, 
The man who knows how to obey, and that man only,   
Knows how to give commands when the time comes. 
You can depend on him, no matter how fast 
The spears come: he’s a good soldier, he’ll stick it out. 
 
Anarchy, anarchy! Show me a greater evil! 
This is why cities tumble and the great houses rain down, 
This is what scatters armies! 
 
No, no: good lives are made so by discipline. 
We keep the laws then, and the lawmakers, 
And no woman shall seduce us. If we must lose, 
Let’s lose to a man, at least! Is a woman stronger than we? 

I’ll have no dealings

HAIMON: 
Father: 
Reason is God’s crowing gift to man, and you are right 
To warn me against losing mine. I cannot say–– 
I hope that I shall never want to say! ––that you  
Have reasoned badly. Yet there are other men 
Who can reason, too; and their opinions might be helpful. 
You are not in a position to know everything 
That people say or do, or what they feel: 
Your temper terrifies them––everyone 
 
Will tell you only what you like to hear. 
But I, at any rate, can listen; and I have heard them 
Muttering and whispering in the dark abut this girl. 
They say no woman has ever, so unreasonably, 
Died so shameful a death for a generous act: 
“She covered her brother’s body. Is this indecent? 
She kept him from dogs and vultures. Is this a crime? 
Death? ––She should have all the honor that we can give her!” 
 
This is the way they talk out there in the city. 
 
You must believe me: 
Nothing is closer to me than your happiness. 
What could be closer? Must not any son 
Value his father’s fortune as his father does his? 
I beg you, do not be unchangeable: 
Do not believe that you alone can be right. 
The man who thinks that, 
The man who maintains that only he has the power 
To reason correctly, the gift to speak, to soul–– 
A man like that, when you know him, turns out empty. 
 
It is not reason never to yield to reason!  
 
In flood time you can see how some trees bend, 
And because they bend, even their twigs are safe, 
While stubborn trees are torn up, roots and all. 
And the same thing happens in sailing: 
Make your sheet fast, never slacken,––and over you go, 
Head over heels and under: and there’s your voyage. 
Forget you are angry! Let yourself be moved! 
I know I am young; but please let me say this: 
The ideal condition 
Would be, I admit, that men should be right by instinct; 
But since we are all too likely to go astray, 
The reasonable thing is to learn from those who can teach.

Must listen to your father. ––Both speak well. 

 

 

You consider it right for a man of my years and experience 
To go to school to a boy? 

 

 

 
If I am wrong. But if I am young, and right, 
What does my age matter? 

It is not right 

You think it right to stand up for an anarchist?   
 

 

Not at all. I pay no respect to criminals.

Love, unconquerable 
Waster of rich men, keeper 
Of warm lights and all-night vigil 
In the soft face of a girl: 
Sea-wanderer, forest-visitor! 
Even the pure Immortals cannot escape you, 
And mortal man, in his one day’s dusk, 
Trembles before your glory. 
 
Surely you swerve upon ruin 
 
The just man’s consenting heart,  
As here you have made bright anger 
Strike between father and son–– 
And none has conquered but Love!

Pleasure to her alone who mock us, 
Merciless Aphrodite.4

And rifting soft snow; her tears are never done.  
I feel the loneliness of her death in mine. 

 
CHORUS:

Are woman, woman-born. If her death is yours, 
A mortal woman’s, is this not for you 
Glory in our world and in the world beyond? 

 

 

 

You laugh at me. Ah, friends, friends, 
Can you not wait until I am dead? O Thebes, 
O men many-charioted, in love with Fortune, 
Dear spring of Dirce, sacred Theban grove, 
Be witnesses for me, denied all pity, 
 
Unjustly judge! and think a word of love 
For her whose path turns 
Under dark earth, where there are no more tears.

That washed him clean and poured the ritual wine: 
And my reward is death before my time! 
 
And yet, as men’s hearts know, I have done no wrong,

And Dryas’ son 8 also, that furious king, 
Bore the god’s prisoning anger for his pride: 
Sealed up by Dionysos in deaf stone, 
His madness died among echoes. 
So at the last he learned what dreadful power 
His tongue had mocked: 
For he had profaned the revels, 
And fired the wrath of the nine 
Implacable Sisters9 that love the sound of the flute.

[Strophe 2] 

 
 
And old men tell a half-remembered tale 
Of horror done where a dark ledge splits the sea 
And a double surf beats on the gray shores: 
How a king’s new woman, 10 sick 
With hatred for the queen he had imprisoned, 
Ripped out his two son’s eyes with her bloody hands 
While grinning Ares 11 watched the shuttle plunge 
Four times: four blind wounds crying for revenge, 
 
Crying, tears and blood mingled, ––Piteously born, 
Those sons whose mother was of heavenly birth! 
Her father was the god of the North Wind 
And she was cradled by gales, 
She raced with young colts on the glittering hills 
And walked untrammeled in the open light: 
But in her marriage deathless Fate found means  
To build a tomb like yours for all her joy.

This is the way the blind man comes, Princes, Princes, 
Lock-step, two heads lit by the eyes of one. 

What new thing have you tell us, old Teiresias?

CREON: 

 
TEIRESIAS: 

I have much to tell you: listen to the prophet, Creon. 

 

I admit my debt to you. But what have you to say? 

Listen, Creon: 
I was sitting in my chair of augury, at the place 
Where the birds gather about me. They were all a-chatter, 
As is their habit, when suddenly I heard 
A strange note in their jangling, a scream, a

10 Eidothea, second wife of King Phineus, blinded her stepsons. (Their mother, Cleopatra, had been imprisoned in a 
cave.).Phineus was the son of a king, and Cleopatra, his first wife, was the daughter of Boreas, the North Wind; but this 
illustrious ancestry could not protect his sons from violence and darkness. [Editors’ note] 
11 God of war. [Editors’ note] 

 

 

 

Whirring fury; I knew that they were fighting, 
Tearing each other, dying 
In a whirlwind of wings clashing. And I was afraid. 
I began the rites of burnt-offering at the altar, 
But Hephaistos 12 failed me: instead of bright flame, 
 
There was only the sputtering slime of the fat thigh-flesh 
Melting: the entrails dissolved in gray smoke, 
The bare bone burst from the welter. And no blaze! 
 
This was a sign from heaven. My boy described it, 
Seeing for me as I see for others.  
 
I tell you, Creon, you yourself have brought 
This new calamity upon us. Our hearths and altars 
Are stained with the corruption of dogs and carrion birds 
That glut themselves on the corpse of Oedipus’ son. 
The gods are deaf when we pray to them, their fire 
Recoils from our offering, their birds of omen 
Have no cry of comfort, for they are gorged 
With the thick blood of the dead. 
 
O my son, 
 
These are no trifles! Think: all men make mistakes, 
But a good man yields when he knows his course is wrong, 
And repairs the evil. The only crime is pride. 
 
Give in to the dead man, then: do not fight with a corpse–– 
What glory is it to kill a man who is dead? 
Think, I beg you: 
It is for your own good that I speak as I do. 
 
You should be able to yield for your own good. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
CREON: 

 

 

 

 

It seems that prophets have made me their especial province. 
All my life long 
I have been a kind of butt for dull arrows 
Of doddering fortune-tellers! 
 
No, Teiresias:   
If your birds––if the great eagles of God himself 
Should carry him stinking bit by bit to heaven, 
I would not yield. I am not afraid of pollution: 
No man can defile the gods. 
 
Go into business, make money, speculate 
 
In India gold or that synthetic gold from Sardis, 
Get rich otherwise than by my consent to bury him. 
Teiresias, it is a sorry thing when a wise man 

Do what you will,

825 

To do what? ––Come, let’s have the aphorism! 

No man who knows that wisdom outweighs any wealth? 

As surely as bribes are baser than any baseness. 

You are sick, Creon! You are deathly sick! 

As you say: it is not my place to challenge a prophet.

The generation of kings has always loved brass. 

You forget yourself! You are speaking to your King. 

I know it. You are a king because of me. 

 

 

 

835 

You have a certain skill; but you have sold out. 

King, you will drive me to words that–– 

 

 
Only remember: I will not pay you for them. 

 

 

 

 

Say them, say them! 

No, you will find them too costly. 

 

 
Whatever you say, you will not change my will. 

 

 

 

 

No doubt. Speak: 

 
TEIRESIAS: 

 

 

Then take this, and take it to heart! 
The time is not far off when you shall pay back 
Corpse for corpse, flesh of your own flesh. 
You have thrust the child of this world into living night, 
You have kept from the gods below the child that is theirs: 
The one on a grave before her death, the other, 
Dead, denied the grave. This is your crime: 
And the Furies and the dark gods of Hell 
Are swift with terrible punishment for you. 
 
Do you want to buy me now, Creon? 
 
 
Not many days, 
And your house will be full of men and women weeping, 
And curses will be hurled at you from far 
Cities grieving for sons unburied, left to rot 
Before the walls of Thebes. 
 
These are my arrows, Creon: they are all for you. 
 
 
But come, child: lead me home. 
Let him waste his fine anger upon younger men. 
Maybe he will learn at last 
To control a wiser tongue in a better head.

Remain to plague us. I am old, too, 
But I cannot remember that he was ever false. 

That is true… .  It troubles me. 
Oh it is hard to give in! but it is worse 
To risk everything for stubborn pride. 

 

 
CHORAGOS: 

Creon: take my advice. 

 

 

What shall I do? 

 
CREON: 

 

 
 

 

Go quickly: free Antigone from her vault 
And build a tomb for the body of Polyneices. 

You would have me do this? 

And it must be done at once: God moves 
Swiftly to cancel the folly of stubborn men. 

 

 

Creon, yes! 

It is hard to deny the heart! But i 
Will do it: I will not fight with destiny. 

You must go yourself, you cannot leave it to others.

MESSENGER: 

Men of the line of Kadmos 16you who live 
Near Amphion’s citadel: 

I cannot say 
Of any condition of human life “This is fixed, 
This is clearly good, or bad.” Fate raises up, 
And Fate casts down the happy and unhappy alike: 
No man can foretell his Fate. 

Take the case of Creon: 

Creon was happy once, as I count happiness: 
Victorious in battle, sole governor of the land, 
Fortunate father of children nobly born. 
And now it has all gone from him! Who can say 
That a man is still alive when his life’s joy fails? 
He is a walking dead man. Grant him rich, 
Let him live like a king in his great house: 
If his pleasure is gone, is would not give 
So much as the shadow of smoke for all he owns. 
 

Your words hint at sorrow: what is your news for us? 

They are dead. The living are guilt of their death. 

Who is guilty? Who is dead? Speak! 

 
Haimon is dead; and the land that killed him 
Is his own hand. 

Haimon.

CHORAGOS: 

 
EURIDICE: 

I have heard something, friends: 
As I was unlocking the gate of Pallas’ 17 shrine, 
For I needed her help today, I heard a voice 
Telling of some new sorrow. And I fainted 
There at the temple with all my maidens about me. 
But speak again: whatever it is, I can bear it: 
Grief and I are no strangers. 

 
MESSENGER: 

Dearest Lady, 

I will tell you plainly all that I have seen. 
I shall not try to comfort you: what is the use, 
Since comfort could lie only in what is not true? 
The truth is always best. 

I went with Creon 

To the outer plain where Polyneices was lying, 
No friend to pity him, his body shredded by dogs. 
We made our prayers in that place to Hecate 
And Pluto, 18 that they would be merciful. And we bathed 
The corpse with holy water, and we brought 
Fresh-broken branches to burn what was left of it, 
And upon the urn we heaped up a towering barrow 
Of the earth of his own land. 

When we are done, we ran 
To the vault where Antigone lay on her couch of stone.  
One of the servants had gone ahead, 
And while he was yet far off he heard a voice 
Grieving within the chamber, and he came back 
And told Creon. And as the King went closer, 
 
The air was full of wailing, the words lost, 
And he begged us to make all haste. “Am I a prophet?” 
He said, weeping, “And must I walk this road, 
The saddest of all that I have gone before? 
My son’s voice calls me on. Oh quickly, quickly! 
Look through the crevice there, and tell me 
 
If it is Haimon, or some deception of the gods!” 
 
We obeyed; and in the cavern’s farthest corner 
We saw her lying: 

 

 

                                                            
17 Pallas Athene, goddess of wisdom. [Editors’ note] 
18 Hecate and Pluto (also known as Hades) were deities of the underworld. [Editors’ note]

She had made a noose of her fine linen veil 
And hanged herself. Haimon lay beside hers, 
His arms about her waist, lamenting her, 
His love lost under ground, crying out 
That his father has stolen her away from him. 
 
When Creon saw him the tears rushed to his eyes 
And he called to him: “What have you done, child? Speak to me. 
What are you thinking that makes your eyes so stranger? 
O my son, my son, I come to you on my knees!” 
But Haimon spat in his face. He said not a word, 
Staring–– 
 
And lunged. Creon shrank back, the blade missed; and the boy, 
Desperate against himself , drove it half its length 
Into his own side, and fell. And as he died 
He gathered Antigone close in his arms again. 
Choking, his blood bright red on her white cheek. 
And now he lies dead with the dead, and she is his 
At last, his bride in the houses of the dead. 
 

And suddenly drew his sword

From darkness to final darkness. Here you see

And all my civic wisdom!

I was the fool, not you; and you died for me. 

 

 

 

 

That is the truth; but you were late in learning it. 

 
CHORAGOS: 

 
CREON: 

This truth is hard to bear. Surely a god 
Has crushed me beneath the hugest weight of heaven,   
And driven me headlong a barbaric way 
To trample out the thing I held most dear. 
 
The pains that men will take to come to pain!

It is right that it should be. I alone am guilty. 
I know it, and I say it. Lead me in, 
Quickly, friends. 
I have neither life nor substance. Lead me in. 

You are right, if there can be right in so much wrong. 
The briefest way is best in a world of sorrow. 

Let it come, 
Let death come quickly, and be kind to me. 
I would not ever see the sun again. 

All that will come when it will; but we, meanwhile, 
Have much to do. Leave the future to itself. 

All my heart was in that prayer! 

Then do not pray any more: the sky is deal 

Lead me away. I have been rash and foolish. 
I have killed my son and my wife. 
I look for comfort; my comfort lies here dead. 
Whatever my hands have touched has come to nothing. 
Fate has brought all my pride to a thought of dust.
