Overall goal:
- Retrieve and process many papers about networks
- Pull out data about networks from the papers and store in a database
- Analyze that data:
	Find correspondences between different data points
	Use to determine the source/type of network by simply knowing its statistics

Plan:
- Convert the papers from pdf/web form into text
- Determine if the papers are applicable to what we are looking for
- Look for keywords/tables that indicate information we can record
- Return a list of pages/lines/phrases that contain the information we need
- Manually or semi-automatically store that data in a database
- Process the recorded data and analyze findings

Properties of networks to look for:

number of components:
	node/vertex/vertices count
	edge count
	average edge count
		node to connection ratio
	size of largest/giant component

directed/undirected network
loops + multi-edges

diameter/geodesic diameter
average connections per node

degree distribution exponent (gamma + gamma symbol)

Microscopic:
- degree
- clustering coeficcient
- centrality
	different kinds of centralities
	degree centrality
	(average) betweeness centrality / load

Macroscopic:
- degree distribution
- total clustering coeficcient
- degree-degree correlations

- modularity (?)

TODO:
Search for numbers near keywords and either increase the score or create a seperate metric for that.
Other advanced language patterns around keywords that indicate that place is what we want.
Do some testing on various keywords and see how well they work with the search.
Searching for and finding tables in the text.
